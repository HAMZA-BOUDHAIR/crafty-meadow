**Objective.** Optimize the aerodynamic performance of a horizontal-axis wind turbine by adjusting blade geometry.  
**Methods.** QBlade software (BEMT theory), aerodynamic coefficients, and performance curves.  
**Results.** Enhanced power coefficient and improved energy yield for medium-speed regimes.
