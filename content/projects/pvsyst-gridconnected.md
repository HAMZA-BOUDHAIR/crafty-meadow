**Organization:** ECOWATT, Agadir â€” April to June 2022  

**Objective:**  
Perform a **techno-economic analysis** and **performance simulation** of a grid-connected photovoltaic system designed to optimize both energy production and financial feasibility.

---

### ðŸ”§ **Work Description**
- Conducted a **technical study** for the design and dimensioning of a solar PV installation connected to the national grid.  
- Implemented detailed **simulations using PVSYST**, including irradiance data, system losses, and module/inverter configuration.  
- Evaluated **energy yield**, **performance ratio (PR)**, and **system losses** (array, inverter, and ohmic).  
- Developed an **economic model** calculating the **LCOE (Levelized Cost of Energy)**, **payback period**, and **investment returns (ROI)**.  
- Analyzed various configurations to identify the optimal **PV array-to-inverter ratio**.

---

### ðŸ“Š **Key Results**
- Achieved a **Performance Ratio (PR)** of approximately **82%**, indicating high system efficiency.  
- Determined an **annual energy yield** of over **1,600 kWh/kWp** under Agadirâ€™s climatic conditions.  
- Calculated a **payback period of ~5.7 years**, with a positive net present value (NPV).  
- Provided optimization strategies to reduce inverter losses and improve self-consumption rates.

---

### ðŸ§° **Tools & Methods**
- **PVSYST v7.2** â€” for simulation and energy modeling  
- **Microsoft Excel / RETScreen** â€” for economic and sensitivity analysis  
- **Climatic data sources:** Agadir meteorological station and Meteonorm database  

---

### ðŸ“ˆ **Outcome**
The study validated the **technical feasibility** and **economic profitability** of grid-connected PV systems in Moroccoâ€™s southern climate.  
The results were used to support ECOWATTâ€™s decision-making in designing future solar installations.
