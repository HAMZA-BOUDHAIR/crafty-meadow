**Organization:** Higher School of Technology, Guelmim â€” March to April 2021  

**Objective:**  
Design, simulate, and evaluate the **performance of a photovoltaic water pumping system** for remote rural areas with limited grid access.

---

### ðŸ”§ **Methodology**
- **Load Assessment:**  
  Determined daily and seasonal water demand for a rural site based on agricultural and domestic consumption patterns.  
- **Solar Resource Analysis:**  
  Used meteorological data (irradiance, temperature) specific to southern Morocco for realistic simulation inputs.  
- **System Sizing:**  
  Designed the PV generator, controller, and pump based on hydraulic head, required flow rate, and solar availability.  
- **Simulation & Optimization:**  
  Conducted simulation to analyze energy yield, pumping hours, and system autonomy under variable weather conditions.  
  Compared **direct-coupled PV pumping** vs. **battery-assisted configurations**.

---

### ðŸ“Š **Key Results**
- Achieved reliable operation for **over 8 hours/day** during sunny months.  
- Water demand was fully covered from **March to October** without external energy input.  
- Identified **efficiency drops** of ~10â€“12% during cloudy periods due to reduced irradiance.  
- Demonstrated significant cost savings compared to diesel pumping systems.

---

### ðŸ§° **Tools & Software**
- **PVSYST** for PV performance modeling.  
- **MATLAB** for system optimization and performance graphs.  
- **RETScreen** for economic and environmental assessment.

---

### ðŸŒ¿ **Impact**
The study validated the **technical feasibility** and **economic advantage** of solar water pumping for sustainable rural development.  
It also proposed recommendations for **scaling up hybrid PV-diesel systems** in agricultural zones.
